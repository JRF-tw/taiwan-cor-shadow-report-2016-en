## COR Points 8-9 National Human Rights Commission

### The Establishment of a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)

<ol start="26">
  <li><p>In order to respond to the Concluding Observations and Recommendations submitted by Independent International Human Rights Experts to the 2013 State Human Rights Report on the two international human rights covenants and the 2014 State Report on the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Presidential Office Human Rights Consultative Committee set up a task force to study the establishment of a national human rights institution. The task force submitted three draft proposals to the consultative committee, namely to establish a NHRC under the Office of the President, under the Executive Yuan or as an institution independent in organization and powers from existing governmental institutions. The content of the National Human Rights Institution Research and Planning Proposal was quite comprehensive and the task force had consulted many government agencies and civil society organizations and even carried out investigative visits abroad. However, senior officials in the government of President Ma Ying-jeou asked the Ministry of Justice on several occasions to review the proposals and also obstructed efforts by NGOs to work with lawmakers to submit related draft legislation to the Legislative Yuan. On December 10, 2015, the Control Yuan introduced a draft organic law to set up a national human rights commission under the Control Yuan under which all 29 members of the Control Yuan would simultaneously serve as commissioners of a national human rights commission.<sup>1</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>The first campaign by NGOs during the late 1990s and early 2000s had already established the principles for a commission-type national human rights institution which would possess robust functions to ensure the protection of human rights, such as quasi-judicial powers of investigation. However, such a commission has yet to be established after over a decade. In addition to the decisive factor of a lack of political will on the party of the ruling authorities, another obstacle has been the constitutional and legal issues involved in the institutional design and positioning of such an institution.</p>

​  <p>Previous points of debate have included questions such as the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Would the establishment of an NHRC under the Office of the President turn into an expansion of presidential powers?</p></li>

      <li><p>Would the NHRC be able to realize the independence in budget and personnel mandated by the Paris Principles if it was established under the Executive Yuan as an independent commission such as the Fair Trade Commission or the National Communications Council?</p></li>

      <li><p>Would it be possible to establish the NHRC as an entirely new independent institution separate from all existing governmental bodies?</p></li>

      <li><p>Would the NHRC and its investigative powers and human rights protection functions be compatible with the existing powers of the Control Yuan?</p></li>

      <li><p>Would the Control Yuan be capable of self-transformation into a NHRC or would the NHRC be established as a subordinate body under the Control Yuan such as the existing Ministry of Audit or as a Human Rights Committee?</p></li>
    </ul>
​  <p>In addition to these questions, there is also still no agreement on the issue of whether the establishment of a NHRC, regardless of where it was situated, require amendment of the Constitution or only require the enactment of legislation.</p></li>

  <li><p>With the joint efforts of the member organizations of the Covenants Watch, President Tsai Ing-wen (then the presidential candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party) publically announced on December 9, 2015 that she would promote the establishment of a national human rights commission if elected in the January 16, 2016 national polls. We urge the new government to abide by its campaign commitment and initiate related legislative and consultative work so that a national human rights commission can be established in accord with the Paris Principles in a reasonable period of time. The need for a human rights institution that can transcend existing government agencies and plan and coordinate all types of human rights promotion and guarantee work has become even more urgent with Taiwan’s incorporation of five core international human rights covenants and conventions into domestic law. For example, Taiwan currently lacks any independent national institution to promote, promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) as mandated by Article 33-2 of said convention.</p>

  <p>The tasks of promoting and protecting human rights prior to the establishment of a national human rights commission</p></li>

  <li><p>Before the establishment of a national human rights commission, we also call on the government to bolster existing mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights. Such work is especially urgent in fields which the government has chronically neglected human rights promotion work and must invest more resources and manpower as well as conduct such work in a more systematic and consultative manner. Such tasks include human rights education for personnel in the judiciary, law enforcement and the civil service (including teachers and medical personnel), enhancing the human rights awareness of ordinary citizens and developing and implementing new methods for human rights monitoring, such as human rights impact assessments and human rights indicators.</p></li>
