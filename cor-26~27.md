## COR Points 26-27 Gender Equality Department and Anti-Discriminations Law

<ol start="91">
  <li><p>The national budget allocation for integrated gender equality purposes is insufficient and we recommend that at least 1% of the annual central government budget expenditures be devoted to gender mainstreaming. Before calculating the national expenditures and resources directly or indirectly related to gender, the government should independently draft a budget and open up convenience and free civic participation.</p></li>

  <li><p>Regarding the evaluation of the effect of gender mainstreaming, we suggest that the Executive Yuan Department of Gender Equality refer to the 2012 United Nations Human Rights Indicators framework and assist central government ministries and agencies and local governments to set up indicators to evaluate the effect of gender mainstreaming operations.</p></li>
