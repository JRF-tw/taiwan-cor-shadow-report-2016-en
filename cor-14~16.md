## COR Points 14-16 Judicial Implementation of the Covenants

<ol start="54">
  <li><p>Regarding the rare number of judicial verdicts which cite the two covenants, the Judicial Yuan has stated that it will send copies of the two covenants and their associated general comments to all levels of courts for use as reference by judges and will also include courses on human rights guarantees into professional training for judges. However, lower level courts or administrative agencies have actually often cited a resolution issued on August 12, 2014 by the Association of Supreme Administrative Court Chief Judges as a standard for delineating whether the two covenants are applicable based on whether “there are clear provisions for the content and key conditions for a claim.” In cases for which it is judged that the covenants lack “clear provision,” the provision for the human right guarantee in question will only be considered to be declaratory and the people will have no foundations to use the two covenants as a basis for a claim in public law and the people’s right to petition for legal redress will therefore be gravely obstructed.</p></li>

  <li><p>Paragraph 10 of General Comment 9 for the ICESCR issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) in December 1998 states “it is important to distinguish between justiciability (which refers to those matters which are appropriately resolved by the courts) and norms which are self-executing (capable of being applied by courts without further elaboration).” In the case of provisions which are not capable of immediate implementation, courts still must explain the relevance of the articles of the covenants in verdicts and to explain in detail the reasons for their judgments. The above-mentioned Supreme Administrative Court resolution failed to take into account General Comment 9 and review whether the articles of the two covenants clearly and precisely influenced the legal action filed by the people. Furthermore, the resolution, in the case at hand did not refer to the related provisions of the General Comment with regard to “the right to family life,” determined that the “the right of family life” manifested in the two covenants was a vague declaratory principle and thus abrogated the people’s right to appeal for judicial remedy.</p></li>

  <li><p>Furthermore, there have already been three judicial verdicts which have cited this Supreme Administrative Court resolution in determining that Article 11 Section 1 of the ICESCR regarding “the right to adequate housing” was only declaratory in nature and could not be used as a basis for petitions in public law for provision of resettlement even in cases of forcible eviction. One of the verdicts even stated that active pursuit by the people of the right of resettlement “depends on the legislative branch to provide clear and precise provisions based on the will of the nation regarding the content and conditions for a so-called right of adequate living.” Subsequently, the government agencies in question, in this case the Taipei Detention Center of the MOJ Agency of Corrections, were unable to achieve this standard and “the people could only use this as the basis to appeal to the judgment of the court for assistance in protecting their rights.” We believe that the Supreme Administrative Court had made an erroneous interpretation of the question of justiciability.</p></li>

  <li><p>Taiwan courts maintain that they cannot issue judicial judgments regarding the distribution of resources by the executive branch or impose restrictions on executive branch budgets. In a 2015 verdict concerned with “the right to adequate housing, “the Taiwan Supreme Administrative Court (Verdict 2015 Panzi 447) found that the State’s forcible eviction “involved striking a balance between resource distribution policies and the so-called ‘people’s right for adequate living standards and also involved conflicts among pluralistic interest and values.” The court declared that the ICESCR had only expounded norms but still had not concretized its stipulations. However, we believe that, in the face of cases of forced evictions, courts should not advocate that the right to housing protected by the ICESCR because of should not be applied because the judiciary’s power in “the distribution of resources is subject to restrictions.”</p></li>

  <li><p>The Chinese language version of the General Comments was edited by scholars invited by the Ministry of Justice and is based primarily on a translation in simplified characters issued by China. Using General Comment No. 7 (regarding adequate housing and forced evictions) on the ICESCR, the Chinese version of Paragraphs 8 and 16 water down the obligation and thereby creates an erroneous interpretation of the State party’s obligations. We recommend that the MOJ carry out a broad-based review and proof-reading of this edition.</p></li>

  <li><p>We suggest that the MOJ’s list of the citation of provisions of the two covenants in court judgments be arranged based on a categories of human rights issues to highlight cases related to each type of human rights.</p></li>
