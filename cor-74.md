<ol start="304">
  <li><p>Since the fifth Legislative Yuan took office in early in 2004 to the present, lawmakers have off and on discussed the enactment of ethnic equality or other similar laws. In 2009, the “Fan Lan-chin” Incident sparked an especially intense debate about ethnic equality laws. At that time, lawmakers from various political parties put forward nine different bills, most of which were directed against the dissemination of hate speech.</p></li>

  <li><p>Since the seating of the ninth Legislative Yuan in February 2016, several lawmakers have separately submitted or announced intentions to draft anti-discrimination laws, including the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of race or ethnicity, status of immigrants, gender identity or mental or physical handicaps. A draft “ethnic equality act” was approved for its first reading by the Legislature’s Interior Affairs Committee on July 13, 2016.</p></li>
