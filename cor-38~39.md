## COR Points 38-39 Migrant Labour and Other Labour Conditions (ICESCR Articles 6-7)

### Migrant household service workers are not protected by the Labour Standards Act

<ol start="137">
  <li><p>The Experts emphasized that the conditions of migrant household service workers need improvement, but the Migrant Empowerment Network (MENT), which proposed a civil society version of a draft “Household Services Act” in June 2003, noted that the Ministry of Labour had not taken any action to improve the conditions for household worker after the Experts issued their Conclusions and Observations in 2013.<sup>56</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>In August 2015, five countries which export labour to Taiwan jointly demanded that the wages of household migrant service workers be raised. Effective September 1, 2015, the MOL raised the wages for household migrant workers, which had been frozen for 18 years, but even after the hike, wages for migrant household workers have not reached the level of the basic wage mandated by the Labour Standards Act<sup>57</sup>. Meanwhile, the draft “Domestic Worker Protection Act” proposed by the MOL in June 2014, remains stranded in the Executive Yuan. The draft bill’s stipulations on work time, vacation and other conditions for household workers were relegated to “mutual agreement between labour and management.” This feature completely ignores asymmetric power relations between employer and employee in households and will render the draft act unable to resolve the long-standing problems of excessive work time and insufficient vacation time for migrant household workers.</p></li>

  <li><p>Taiwan’s Long-Term Care System administered by the MOHW does not encompass household migrant workers. The MOHW has been responsible for promoting two laws, namely the Long-Term Care Service Act which was enacted in June 2015 and the Long-Term Care Insurance Act submitted to legislative review in June 2016, as the legal framework for the long-term care system. However, migrant household workers are not included in the human resource planning for the long-term care and the promotion of the long-term care system may therefore be unable to improve the “blood and sweat” conditions for migrant household workers.<sup>58</p></li>

  <li><p>Beginning in 2013, MENT and the Taiwan International Workers’ Association (TIWA) have called on MOHW and the MOL to definitely bring migrant household workers into the human resource planning for the new long-term care system<sup>59</sup> and for the elimination of the individual person homecare system and its replacement by institutional employment of “foreign careworkers.” Only in this way can the problems of the exploitation of migrant household workers and the shortage of human resources for the long-term care system be resolved in tandem. However, the two ministries have ignored these calls and are instead even considering marketization of long-term care.<sup>60</sup> Marketization would inevitably lead to “bad money driving out the good” and injure both the receivers and givers of care services.</p></li>

### Fishery Workers Face Dire Conditions

<ol start="141">
  <li><p>The channels for recruitment of fishing workers or crew are divided into hiring inside Taiwan and hiring outside of Taiwan’s borders. Crew hired in Taiwan are covered by the Employment Service Act, while crew hired outside of Taiwan come under the purview of the “Regulations on Overseas Employment of Foreign Crew Members by Owners of Fishing Vessels” under the authority of the Fisheries Agency of the COA. The types of overseas hiring arrangements are also divided into two categories. One type involves workers directly employed by Taiwan employers but whose work contract is signed outside of Taiwan. The second type concerns temporary workers on assignment in which the worker is first hired by a Taiwan or foreign company or by a labour brokerage and then assigned to Taiwan fishing boats as crew. However, the fishing boat in question may be flying a flag of convenience (FOC) due to fishing in other waters and the involvement of numerous people of different nations may lead to many problems as the labour-management rights and obligations may involve laws and regulations on labour service in multiple countries. For example, whether the labour contract must be in accord with the LSA and whether the conditions for crew on fishing vessels can be worse than allowed by the LSA can be very much open to question. At present, the MOJ, MOL and COA have divergent views on whether to require the protections of the Labour Standards Act for foreign crew working on Taiwan fishing vessels.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Giant Ocean Trafficking Case: The dismal conditions faced by foreign fishing workers and the loose state of legal frameworks and enforcement has been concretely exposed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and international NGOs such as Greenpeace as well as being reported by international media such as the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Foreign workers encounter unreasonable conditions as crew on fishing vessels, including infringements on human rights and labour rights. For example, unscrupulous labour brokers may use the cover of recruiting labour to actually engage in human trafficking or forced labour or slavery. In the Giant Ocean case, the Taiwan manager of the Giant Ocean International Fishery Co. Ltd illegally trafficked over 1,000 Cambodian fishing workers who were beaten, starved, tortured and even threatened with death. As a result, Giant Ocean was indicted by the Cambodian government and six Taiwanese were charged by the Cambodian government with human trafficking. However, only one Taiwanese was arrested and is serving a prison term in Cambodia. The other five Taiwanese are fugitives, but the Taiwan government has yet to arrest or indict them.<sup>61</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>The labour rights of fishermen hired in Taiwan are not protected. Under the protection of the Labour Standards Act, migrant fishing workers should at least receive the basic wage and should have a ceiling on work time and, if work time exceeds the limit, the employer should pay overtime. However, due to the lack of sufficient government labour inspectors and a shortage of labour, almost all fishing crew are unable to receive overtime payments for excessive work. Most labour contracts have provisions for “profit-sharing” from the catch, but it appears that no fishing crew have every received any “dividends.” The employer should enlist employees in the national labour insurance program, but many employers substitute commercial insurance. In addition, after deductions of fees for domestic and overseas labour brokers and for room and boarding, just over half of the basic wage is actually the highest wage that foreign crew can expect.</p></li>

  <li><p>On the grounds that “it’s difficult to protect documents when working on the seas,” foreign fishermen are required to sign “since most foreign fishing boat crews are required to sign “voluntary agreements” of “requests to the employer/broker to take custody” of personal documents. As a result, the foreign worker does not have key identification documents such as his passport, Alien Registration Certificate (ARC) and seafarer’s certificate on him when he is at sea. Moreover, wages are often not paid on time every month for reasons of being “at sea,” not to mention failure by the employer to provide employees with bilingual wage payment certificate as required by both the LSA or the ESA. In terms of living costs, the employer/broker may use an interpretation of the LSA made by the then Council of Labour to the effect that “wages can be paid in kind.” In recent years, cases have been reported in which up to NT$5000 a month (about one-fourth of the nominal monthly wage or one half of the actually received wage) is deducted for “room and board.” Foreign fishing boat crew whose wages are deducted for “room and board” often face actual problems in basic living such as not being able to sleep or to eat full meals. The rights to food, housing and health care are all mentioned in the Concluding Observations and Recommendations as fundamental rights that are frequently unobtainable for foreign fishing workers even if they pay for them. All of these situations are subject to various laws and regulations, but the reality that “laws and regulations cannot be realized” is the prime reason why the labour and basic living rights of foreign fishing workers are being sacrificed.<sup>62</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>We advocate that all fishing workers, whether hired in Taiwan or abroad, should be covered under the LSA and other related labour laws and regulations. The LSA and other laws and regulations originally did not distinguish the nationality or background of workers or whether they were legal residents but applied to all persons in the territories under Taiwan’s legal jurisdiction, including Taiwan-registered fishing vessels. The Fisheries Administration has used two administrative regulations (such as the Regulations on Overseas Employment of Foreign Crew Members by Owners of Fishing Vessels), which have lower status than laws, to exclude foreign fishing workers and Chinese fishing workers from the scope of application in violation of legal principles. We call on the Executive Yuan to convene as soon as possible a cross-ministerial conference and invite the MOJ, the MOL, the COA and other concerned agencies to resolve the disputes over the question of the scope of application of these laws and restore the legal protections of the LSA and other Taiwan laws and regulations.</p></li>

  <li><p>Labour on the high seas has special and unique characteristics compared to other types of work and there are also huge differences among work at sea among the different types of fishing operations. The government should promptly launch consultations with scholars, civic organizations and representatives of fishing workers on whether Taiwan should enact a special chapter in the LSA or even a special law to regulate work at sea. Such consultations can refer to the stipulations of the ILO Work in Fishing Convention (No. 188) regarding the provision of minimum working conditions, housing, food, occupational safety, medical and health care and other social protections.</p></li>

  <li><p>Carrying out labour inspections and monitoring of fishing vessels at sea is a very difficult task that involves not only the applicability of law but how such duties can be feasibly implemented. Besides intensifying education among fishing boat owners, the MOL and COA can also use bilateral agreements and joint cooperation with the mother countries of the fishing workers to raise awareness of fishing workers’ rights. Taiwan agencies can also use in tandem regulatory documentation (such as registration and notifications) and the implementation of actual labour inspections within the scope of their capability. They should also proactively cooperate and coordinate with international and regional government and non-governmental organizations to find the most feasible mechanisms for labour inspection and monitoring.</p></li>

  <li><p>The government has already ratified several core international human rights covenants and conventions and, as early as 1964, ratified ILO Convention No. 118 concerning “Equality of Treatment of Nationals and Non-Nationals in Social Security.” The government must abide by its obligations under the convention and protect the basic human rights of all fishing workers.</p></li>

### The Problem of High Brokerage Fees

<ol start="149">
  <li><p>High brokerage fees have always been the heaviest burden borne by blue-collar migrant workers in Taiwan. Article 8 of the Act to Implement the ICCPR and the ICESCR which entered force on December 10, 2009 mandated that: “All levels of governmental institutions and agencies should review laws, regulations, directions and administrative measures within their functions according to the two Covenants. All laws, regulations, directions and administrative measures incompatible to the two Covenants should be amended within two years after the Act enters into force by new laws, law amendments, law revocations and improved administrative measures.” However, the Taiwan government has not taken any concrete action with regard to “high brokerage fees.” Even after the Concluding Observations and Recommendations were issued in January 2003, related government agencies (including the MOL) have remained indifferent.</p></li>

  <li><p>On August 12, 2013, TIWA held a news conference in Taipei City exposing the upgrading of cross-border cooperation among brokers to a “2.0 version” that not only forced migrant workers coming to Taiwan to sign large “individual/family loan contracts” but also compelled them to sign promissory notes. After foreign workers arrive in Taiwan, they would be required to deposit the notes, at an additional fee of NT$500 per note, with debt collection company and thus allow Taiwan courts to become the “accomplices” of brokers charging illegally high fees.<sup>63</sup> On May 19, 2015, the Control Yuan disclosed the results on an investigation and issued a recommendation that “promissory notes should be revoked.” However, although there have been numerous suits filed on such cases in the past three years, only one resulted in a victory for the foreign worker plaintiff, further demonstrating the lack of any positive action on the part of government agencies (including the MOL and MOJ).</p></li>
</ol>

### Workers cannot freely change employers

<ol start="151">
  <li><p>According to stipulations of the Employment Service Act, blue-collar foreign workers still cannot freely change employers. Moreover, given the ineffectiveness of labour inspections and the MOL’s “1955” protection hotline for foreign workers and the manner with which local government officials handle complaints, migrant workers often encounter situations in which they do not really receive assistance after filing complaints. Therefore, “flight” often becomes the only option for self-protection. Even more important is the fact that even if employers themselves believe that “agreement to transfer” is a better choice, the problems in the design of the blue-collar migrant worker system ensure that every carrot will have its own pit. The departure of a blue-collar migrant worker will cause the factory owner to lose one of his quota of foreign workers, while employer of a household care worker will have to wait until the departing migrant worker finds a new employer before being able to hire a replacement.</p></li>

  <li><p>“Flight” leads to other trials. The result of a system that turns migrant workers into virtual slaves is that migrant workers who are “in flight” are commonly subject to discrimination. If an “escaped foreign worker” gets ill or gets involved in a labour-management dispute or other situations that threat his or her health or labour rights, he or she will usually choose not to go to the hospital or to file a complaint since entry into any system or facility which requires identification documents could lead to deportation. Therefore, “informing on an escaped foreign worker” constitutes a kind of institutional abnormal exploitation that allows illegal employers or anyone use the threat of exposure of his or her “illegal” status as a club to threaten an “escaped foreign worker” to do anything that the potential informant wants. Indeed, besides failing to fulfil the requirement of the implementation act for the two covenants to carry out a review and improvement of all laws and regulations within two years after the implementation act’s promulgation, the NIA has actually made matters worse! On June 21, 2015, the NIA introduced a new smart phone “Anti-ARC Counterfeiting APP.” Thanks to this application, anyone can at any time check the valid dates and other personal data on any “Alien Resident Certificates” issued after 2002 by scanning their barcodes. We believe this system encourages “everyone to arrest escaped foreign workers” and constitutes concrete evidence of the hostility toward blue collar migrant workers on the part of State authority and is furthermore an incentive for society at large to view all “foreign workers” and “foreign spouses” as “suspects.” We demand that this unrestricted expansion of executive power be revoked immediately.<sup>64</sup></p>

  <p>The right to emergency medical care for childbirths of migrant workers who have overstayed their residency period (related to ICESCR Article 12)</p></li>

  <li><p>According to Article 14 of the Protection of Children and Youths Welfare and Rights Act, persons who deliver babies must report relevant birth information to the local health authority within seven days after the delivery of the baby. In 2004, the reporting system for new births was fully put on the internet. Household registration and immigration agencies and other different agencies can link to the notification system and obtain information on childbirths and the parents of the new infant.</p></li>

  <li><p>The original intent of the above-mentioned regulation was to gain an accurate understanding of population trends and to provide a factual basis for the provision of subsequent health and sanitation services for women and children. However, given the occurrence of pregnant women who were migrant workers who were overstaying their residence periods, the actual operation of this regulation turned hospitals, which should have protected the health of mothers and newly born infants, into informers against missing migrant workers and forced the latter to worry that going to the hospital could result in deportation instead of proper pre-partum and childbirth care. This state of affairs is not healthy for the expecting mother and may well threaten the health or even life of the fetus or newly born infant.</p></li>

  <li><p>To avoid causing children of overstaying migrant workers to become unregistered persons, we believe the government definitely must adopt effective preventative and intervening measures. However, using health care systems or immigration databases to find migrant workers who have lost contact could make it impossible for such workers to feel safe to approach hospitals or clinics when they need medical assistance. Such a situation will neither represent a solution nor protect the best interests of the children in question.</p></li>
