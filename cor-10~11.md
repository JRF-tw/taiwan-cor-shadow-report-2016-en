## COR Points 10-11 United Nations Core Human Rights Covenants and Conventions

<ol start="30">
  <li><p>Point 10 of the Concluding Observations and Recommendations noted that Taiwan has promulgated implementation acts for three core human rights covenants and conventions. These acts clearly mandate that obligations under these covenants and conventions prevail over other laws, with the exception of the Constitution, in the event of any inconsistency and that all domestic laws, regulations or administrative measures which are not in accordance with the covenants or conventions in question should be revised within a certain period of time. Subsequently, in 2014, Taiwan also enacted similar implementation acts which ensured a similar legal status for the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the CRPD.</p></li>

  <li><p>Nevertheless, there is controversy regarding the status of the covenants and conventions in judicial work and within administrative agencies. In terms of judicial work, there have been some judgments which have explicitly citied the covenants or conventions and have advocated that they are equivalent to “human rights basic laws” or that the covenants or conventions should have precedence when there are inconsistencies with domestic law. However, some judges have opposed such views and maintain that the status of the covenants and conventions cannot supersede the finding of Interpretation 329 issued by the Constitution Court on December 24, 1993 that “treaties hold the same status as laws.”</p></li>

  <li><p>Based on Article 8 of the Act for the Implementation for the ICCPR and ICESCR, the Executive Yuan issued instructions on December 14, 2009 requiring all levels of government agencies to carry out a review of existing laws and regulations. The process of revision of some of the laws and regulations identified by the Executive Yuan Subcommittee on Human Rights Protection as contradicting the two covenants has yet to be completed. Nevertheless, the government has not continued to carry out re-examination of laws and regulations for compliance with the two covenants. For example, civil society organizations have advocated that foreign household workers be guaranteed the basic wage as based on the ICESCR and that portions of the Assembly and Parade Act be directly rendered invalid due to contravention of Article 21 of the ICCPR. However, government agencies have maintained that the covenants cannot be directly applied until the Legislative Yuan completes the process of revising laws in question.</p></li>

  <li><p>We advocate that the State must realize in a suitable manner all of the obligations for human rights guarantees embodied in an international human rights covenant or convention as soon as it completes the process of becoming part of domestic law. Before a law is revised, the executive government agencies should use various provisional measures to implement the human rights protections; the legislative branch should take it upon itself to refrain from enacting laws which violate international human rights covenants or conventions; and the judiciary should substantively apply the covenants and ensure the people’s fundamental rights when delivering judgments. The government should immediately use this kind of interpretation to appreciate the statement by the panel of independent human rights experts that the obligations of each covenant “prevail over other laws, with the exception of the Constitution.”</p></li>

### Regarding the CRC and the CRPD

<ol start="34">
  <li><p>The Legislative Yuan enacted implementation acts for the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) on June 4, 2014 and August 20, 2014, respectively. However, the Executive Yuan did not submit the ratification bills for the two covenants themselves to the Legislative Yuan for review until November 20, 2014 and November 27, 2014, respectively, or after enactment of the respective implementation acts. As a result, the CRC and the CRPD were only ratified by the Legislative Yuan on April 22, 2016.</p></li>

  <li><p>Based on the implementation acts for the CRC and CRPD, the Executive Yuan established the “Executive Yuan Child and Juvenile Welfare and Rights Promoting Team” and the “Executive Yuan Rights of Persons with Disabilities Promoting Team” to plan, coordinate, monitor and promote the implementation of the conventions at all levels of government. However, these members of these two task forces concurrently held posts in other agencies and the actual agency for the implementation of these two conventions has been the Social and Family Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW). As a result, these two task forces have been unable to realize their functions of monitoring the government and providing policy guidance. Since most of the civil society members on the task force for child and juvenile rights represent large scale child welfare institutions, many of which directly accept contracts for the provision of state welfare services, how can they manifest the critical and independent spirit of the State Report? In addition, this task force lacks representation of the perspective of rights and pluralism due to the over-representation of protective child welfare organizations and the relative lack of child and juvenile developmental welfare organizations as well as the lack of any children or juvenile members.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Social and Family Affairs Administration used an open bidding process to commission academic institutions to carry out the work of re-examination of laws and regulations, education and training and the drafting of state reports at a cost of NT$30,381,196 (US$1=NT$32).</p>

  <p>However, civil society organizations believe that state agencies should themselves bear responsibility for the actual implementation of these human rights covenants and conventions. The Office for Child Rights Special Projects is staffed by short-term contractual employees with a high rate of turnover and was clearly established to cope with the international review and not for sustained promotion of the implementation of the convention.</p></li>
</ol>

### Regarding the ICERD

<ol start="37">
  <li><p>The ROC government had already ratified the ICERD before it left the United Nations in October 1971. This convention took effect in Taiwan on January 1, 1971, but the government has not carried out the obligations of implementing the ICERD during the past 44 years.</p></li>

  <li><p>According to Paragraph 4 of the State Report, the government invited experts and scholars to discuss whether to separately enact an implementation act for the ICERD or to enact a special law against racial discrimination after the international review of the first ICCPR-ICESCR State Report. However, we are unable to evaluate the degree of progress in these efforts as the government has not publically disclosed the related materials, proceedings or resolutions of those meetings.</p></li>

  <li><p>We urge the government to hold discussions on the incorporation into domestic law of related international covenants and conventions. The government should invite a wide range of representatives from various ethnic groups and civil society organizations, including indigenous peoples, Pingpu people, Hakka people, Tibetans resident in Taiwan, new immigrants and migrant workers, to jointly discuss how to realize the early ratification of related international human rights conventions. The Ministry of Interior should ensure that the process of such deliberations are open and transparent.</p></li>
</ol>

### Regarding CAT and OPCAT

<ol start="40">
  <li><p>With regard to CAT and OPCAT, the Ministry of Interior has already completed a draft implementation act for CAT. In line with the Optional Protocol’s call for the establishment of a national preventive mechanism, the MOI is considering using Article 6 of the draft implementation act to establish a national commission for the prevention of torture under the Control Yuan. This proposal has received the preliminary approval of the Control Yuan, but would require revision of the Organic Law of the Control Yuan.</p></li>

  <li><p>However, during a meeting held on this issue on September 24, 2015, a representative of the Department of Prosecutorial Affairs of the MOJ advocated that, based on the newly promulgated “Conclusion of Treaties Law,” so long as the treaty bill has completed its legal process, it will have domestic effect and a separate implementation act will not be necessary. However, in light of Taiwan’s special international situation, a signed covenant or convention may have domestic law effect, but it may be impossible to realize international legal validity through ratification by the Legislative Yuan and completion of the procedure of the deposit of the ratification documents with the UN secretariat. The importance of the use of implementation acts for the convention lies in the fact that the Taiwan government is at present unable to carry out the monitoring procedure mandated by the covenants and conventions and accept direct monitoring by the UN human rights system.</p></li>

  <li><p>The implementation acts have at least two objectives, namely to allow the articles of the covenants or conventions to have effect in domestic law and to clarify the human rights obligations undertaken by the government in the wake of the incorporation of human rights covenants and conventions into domestic law. These obligations include measures such as the human rights state report system, reexamination of laws and regulations, provision of necessary budgets and the establishment of monitoring institutions. We therefore urge the new government which took office in May 2016 to promptly submit the draft implementation act for the CAT and the Optional Protocol to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p></li>
</ol>

### Regarding the ICRMW

<ol start="43">
  <li><p>Taiwan’s small and medium enterprises, household care services and ocean-going fishing boats all depend heavily on the contributions of the large numbers of migrant workers from Southeast Asian nations. However, Taiwan has been subject to criticism for the lack of proportionate human rights protections for migrant workers and for having a “sweat and blood” system which infringes on the human rights of migrant workers. Therefore, incorporation into domestic law of the ICRMW is extremely important.</p></li>

  <li><p>In December 2014, the Ministry of Labour (MOL) completed a subcontracted research assessment on how to incorporate the ICRMW into domestic law, but the MOL has not taken any further action for well over a year.</p></li>
</ol>

### Regarding the ICCPED

<ol start="45">
  <li><p>There has been almost no progress in enactment of the ICCPED. The MOJ claims that Taiwan’s domestic legal system already meets the core obligations of the ICCPED and therefore has hesitated to undertake efforts to incorporate the convention into domestic law. However, the MOJ has failed to take note of the fact that the scope of the convention is precisely to provide a mechanism to carry out investigations and determine responsibility as well as offer protection and reparations for victims and their dependents in the event that some people are forcibly disappeared at times when the domestic legal system is dysfunctional.</p></li>

  <li><p>Numerous cases of disappearances occurred in Taiwan during the nearly four decades of martial law rule. Although Taiwan’s democratic system has improved since that time, we still should use this convention to further upgrade human rights guarantees.</p></li>
