## COR Points 40-41 Minimum Wage and the Poverty Gap (ICESCR Articles 6-7)

<ol start="156">
  <li><p>Although Taiwan has had a basic wage system since 1985, its legal foundation is only the stipulation in Article 21 Paragraph 1 in the Labour Standards Act that “(a) worker shall be paid such wages as determined through negotiations with the employer, provided, however, that such wages shall not fall below the basic wage.” The organization and proceeding of the Basic Wage Committee mandated by the same article was left entirely up to administrative regulations which require that the amount of the basic wage has to finally be approved by the Executive Yuan. Hence, from the start the basic wage system has lacked complete legal foundation, thus allowing the government to possess considerable power to control the basic wage.</p></li>

  <li><p>Due to the lack of a clear formula of calculation, the basic wage determination system has long been nothing more than a market for bargaining between competing forces. The Regulations for the Deliberation of the Basic Wage clearly state that factors such as national economic development, the wholesale price index, consumer price index, national income, per capita income, industry labour productivity, employment status, labour wages in every industry, household income, and other data be considered in adjusting the basic wage. Nevertheless, it is usually difficult to reach consensus as representatives from labour, management, government and academia on the Basic Wage Committee routinely each stick to their own predetermined positions.</p></li>

  <li><p>On occasion, members of the Basic Wage Committee have publically stated that “the trend is not to adjust” the basic wage even before the MOL (or its predecessor Council of Labour Affairs) had even convened a BWC meeting. Indeed, in 2012, based on price indices, BWC members decided to adjust the monthly basic wage from NT$18,780 to NT$19,047. Even though this marked an increase of only 1.42%, the Executive Yuan delayed the monthly increase by imposing two new conditions to block the adjustment, namely that Taiwan’s inflation-adjusted gross domestic product had to show growth of at least 3% in two successive quarters and that the unemployment rate had to drop below 4% for two consecutive months before the adjustment could be implemented. In 2013, under pressure from business and the government, the BWC itself resolved to wait until the accumulated rise in the consumer price index (CPI) reached 3% before convening a meeting. The MOL promptly agreed and the Executive Yuan rushed to approve this illegal resolution which constituted a self-imposed freeze on the basic wage. From these examples, it can be seen that the lack of robust legal foundations has caused the current basic wage system to become nothing more than a tool for the government to arbitrarily control the basic wage rate.</p></li>

  <li><p>In order to avoid the minimum wage from becoming a sacrificial offering for political pressure, the government and legislature should enact a “Minimum Wage Act” to legally institutionalize the minimum wage. Such a law should clearly define the standards for the calculation of the minimum wage, the composition of its deliberation committee and its scope of coverage. A new minimum wage deliberation commission should meet annually and resolve on its level based on a range for an annual change calculated by the Ministry of Labour that matches the need of labour to maintain a stable livelihood in a time of rapid change in the social environment.</p></li>

  <li><p>Based on the “minimum wage spirit” of the International Labour Organization (ILO), labour movement organizations utilized data from the Survey of Family Income and Expenditures and other related national statistical reports from the DGBAS to separately define “employment dependency” and “labour power dependency” (with the labour population defined as including the employed and unemployed) to propose two formulae for calculating the basic wage. If the spirit of “employment dependency” is adopted, the basic wage should be increased to NT$25,997 a month or NT$161 an hour. In August 2015, the MOL Basic Wage Committee resolved not to adjust the basic wage, which is currently NT$20,008 a month or NT$120 an hour. There is evidently a large gap between these figures and the spirit manifested by the international covenants.</p></li>

  <li><p>If the basic wage level of NT$25,997 a month advocated by labour organizations is adopted, statistics of the Bureau of Labour Insurance indicate that the number of workers who reported income less than basic wage was 4,611,301 or 46 percent of the total number of persons participating in the labour insurance system in 2014. If the current basic wage of NT$20,008 a month is used as the standard, this figure would be 26 percent. Even if these statistics may not be entirely accurate due to under-reporting of labour insurance payments by employers, this data confirms the fact that low wages are extremely prevalent in Taiwan.</p></li>

  <li><p>At present, household family care workers and maids, including 223,000 social work migrant workers, whose wages are lower than the basic wage because they are not included in the scope of application of the Labour Standards Act.</p></li>

  <li><p>Labour economy experts note that wages for sheltered employed persons are far below the basic wage. From 2011 through June 2015, the ratio of sheltered workers who received wages of less than NT$6,000 a month was declining, but, as of June 2015, 42.6% of sheltered workers had monthly incomes of less than NT$6,000 and 76.7 percent had monthly wages less than NT$9,000. Since the average per capita monthly living expenses in Taiwan were NT$10,869 in 2015, the income of sheltered workers is still inadequate to meet their daily needs.</p></li>

  <li><p>Wage and salary data for employees indicate that persons with disabilities receive on average 52.3% of the national average wage and salary and that woman receive 20% less than men (See Table I)</p>

  <li><p>The government maintains that sheltered workers are special employees and that employers can pay them based on their actual production capability and, therefore, their wages can be less than the basic wage. Since they cannot obtain basic living guarantees, the shortfall should be covered by subsidies for physically and mentally disabled.</p></li>

  <li><p>However, the current monthly subsidies issued for physically and mentally disabled citizens are NT$3,500, NT$4,700 or NT$8,200, depending on the degree of disability and the economic situation of the recipient. Although sheltered workers can obtain such subsidies, the combined value of wages in sheltered workshops and official living assistance payments is still lower than the basic wage and insufficient to maintain basic living standards.</p></li>
