## COR Points 12-13 The Implementation Act Related to the International Covenants

<ol start="47">
  <li><p>On August 17, 2009, the MOJ requested all government ministries and agencies to conduct a review of laws, regulations and administrative measures for compliance with the ICCPR and ICESCR. This survey generated a list of 219 items for review, while civil society organizations proposed an additional 44 items. The total list of 263 items was submitted to the Executive Yuan Human Rights Protection Committee for review. As of June 30, 2015, the process of review and correction of 39 (14.83%) of these issues have yet to be completed, including 31 cases of laws, seven administrative orders and one administrative measure. This result transgresses Article 8 of Act for Implementation of the ICCPR-ICESCR implementation act.<sup>11</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>In Paragraph 15 of its “Response to the Concluding Observations and Recommendations, “the State notes that the Executive Yuan will include laws that impact on human rights in its “Gender Impact Assessment Review Form” and arrange for experts to conduct assessments on responsible government agencies. An examination of the form shows that it covers eight types of laws. Notably, its Section 7 calls for quantitative evaluation of the possible cost and benefits that government or society will need to bear for the promotion and realisation of a proposed law with relation to human right regulations in the Constitution or the ICCPR or ICESCR or a detailed explanation of such costs and benefits if quantitative assessment is difficult to provide. The form also requires responsible agencies to indicate whether the proposed bill under review is or is not in accordance with the Constitution, the interpretations of the Constitutional Court, the ICCPR or ICESCR and the General Comments of the UN Human Rights Council and of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, respectively.<sup>12</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>We suggest that the State revise the Central Regulation Standards Act and the Administrative Procedures Act in order to mandate that proposed laws, regulations or major administrative measures or plans must pass human rights impact assessments before their approval by the Executive Yuan. Before the completion of the revisions of these two acts, the Presidential Office Human Rights Consultative Committee should complete the redesign of an “Human Rights Impact Assessment Form for Legislation” to include clear identification of objectives and sensitive groups, a clear and precise evaluation method, procedure and categories and related indicators. This evaluation should be included when the Executive Yuan submits draft laws or bills to the Legislative Yuan for review as reference for lawmakers. In addition, the Executive and Legislative branches should bolster training in the appreciation of human rights principles and spirit and human rights impact assessment for legislation.</p></li>

  <li><p>We suggest that Article 8 of the Act to Implement the ICCPR and ICESCR be revised to change the phrase “all laws, regulations, directions and administrative measures incompatible to the two Covenants should be amended within two years after the Act enters into force” to “establish a mechanism for a regular review of all laws, regulations, directions and administrative measures.” At the same time, the procedure and standards for the review should be clarified. For example, the procedures should indicate what laws should be included in the review process under what kinds of conditions. In addition, the revisions should indicate by what agencies and what kind of procedures and instruments should be used to carry out the review after a law enters the review process. For example, civil society organizations and individuals often submit suggestions to government and other public agencies or even have encountered friction in this process, indicating that further review and revision of laws and regulations is necessary. Therefore, we suggest that an “event-based” mechanism to initiate reviews be included.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Executive Yuan Department of Gender Equality bears responsibility for overall planning and organizing for the CEDAW State Report and related Conclusions and Recommendations and subsequent tracking and auditing as well as for organizing special subcommittees of Executive Yuan Gender Equality Committee members and other invited experts and scholars to attend follow-up meetings and provide advice on questionable points or doubts. However, the Department of Gender Equality is constrained by its status and can only pass suggestions to the responsible government ministry or agency and is unable to put forward a comprehensive national action plan. Although the Executive Yuan Gender Equality Committee has a relatively higher status, the effectiveness of the civic special case subcommittee in supervising government agencies is also constrained by the delineation of its role and challenges over its accountability and representativeness.</p></li>

  <li><p>Government agencies responsible for each conclusion or recommendation have been easily able to adopt conservative mentalities and separate their operations from their impact. Moreover, rates of attendance and the level of representation at follow-up meetings has been low. When officials do attend, they usually do not have sufficient authorization and are unable to immediately respond to questions raised in discussions. In addition, the progress and efficiency of meetings have been affected by the lack of sufficient understanding on the part of some agencies about and the procedures for the State Report.</p></li>

  <li><p>We suggest that: (1) The Executive Yuan Gender Equality Committee should openly accept recommendations by civil society organizations of commissioners familiar with CEDAW and local women’s issues and other methods to bolster its representativeness; (2) The rate of attendance and the level of representation at Executive Yuan Gender Equality Committee meetings should be increased. The Central Personnel Office should conduct annual courses to bolster basic understanding of CEDAW and capability to discuss related issues and formulate gender policies.</p></li>
