## COR Points 20-21 Transparency and Participation in Decision-making

### Citizen Participation and Policy-Making in Land Development and Housing

<ol start="66">
  <li><p>On informal settlements on state-owned land: The National Land Clean-up and Reactivation Superintendent Squad is at present the decision-making body regarding the determination of policies on state owned land. This body was established through an administrative direction instead of law by the Executive Yuan on November 27, 2009 as a cross-ministerial task force attended by representatives of at least vice-ministerial levels,<sup>20</sup> whose meetings are consistently held without advance notification and lack mechanisms for public participation, and the records are usually brief or abbreviated. Therefore, civil society and even the Legislative Yuan have been unable to carry out effective after-the-fact monitoring or supervision. Nevertheless, this task force can make policy decisions on state-owned land and properties which occupy over 60 percent of Taiwan’s total land area and therefore can have major impact on land development, environmental protection, social welfare and national fiscal policies. These decisions can also affect the housing rights of inhabitants on the informal settlements. (Please also refer to Paragraph 210 below regarding Point 49 in Response to the Concluding Observations and Recommendations).</p></li>

  <li><p>On urban renewal: At present, several sets of proposed draft revisions to the Urban Renewal Act, originally promulgated in November 1998 and last amended in May 2010, are in the stage explanatory meetings, public hearings and review in the Legislative Yuan Interior Affairs Committee.<sup>21</sup> Under current regulations, the people can only provide verbal testimony or written petitions, a situation not in keeping with the principle of effective or meaningful participation. In Interpretation 709 regarding “Review and Approval of Urban Renewal Business Summaries and Plans” issued on April 26, 2013,<sup>22</sup> the Constitutional Court declared that the act should be revised to add provisions for public hearings proceedings with the function of debate in order to protect public participation. Although the original draft of the second State Report stated that the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) had revised its “Directions for Urban Renewal Hearing Proceeding of the Ministry of the Interior” effective December 22, 2014 and that local governments had held 222 hearings under its procedures, the State Report offered no further explanation regarding: (a) why the Ministry of the Interior revised the “Directions for Urban Renewal Hearing Proceedings,” and administrative direction, instead of the Urban Renewal Act to implement the hearings; and, (b) preparatory meetings are not held before urban renewal hearings in order to collect points of dispute and do not feature pluralistic debate. Moreover, urban renewal review committee members do not need to provide reasons why they adopt or do not adopt the conclusions of urban renewal meetings. It is evident that the urban renewal meetings as held in the present manner are not in accord with the principle of effective participation.</p></li>

  <li><p>On urban land consolidation: Urban land consolidation implemented by the public sector process is based on the sequences of land area selection and approval, assessment of land value and cadastral survey, and ground-breaking.<sup>23</sup> Before approval of the site selection, there are no notifications of stakeholders or hearings. Only 30 days after the approval of the selected area is publically announced can owners of land in the selected zone use notifications of the announcement as the basis to put forward objections. Only if the number of landowners who object must exceed half of the total number of landowners and over half of the privately - owned land area would the responsible agencies convene another review meeting on the proposed case. Moreover, as there are no legal standards regulating what would be the appropriate manner to carry out such a re-examination, the central government responsible agency can act based on its own conscience. On the other hand, in the case of urban land consolidations implemented by the private sector, the lower thresholds for approval is too low to protect the interests of relatively disadvantaged or weak landowners; similarly, no hearings or consultations are needed before official approvals, and the process is far from transparent.<sup>24</sup> Furthermore, although the process is initiated by private-sector landowners, adjacent public - owned property can also be included in the area for consolidation.<sup>25</sup> But residents living on public owned lands, being in fact stakeholders, are unable to receive any advance information and face being included in the area of consolidation which usually leads to eviction.</p></li>

  <li><p>On zone expropriations: Zone expropriation at present are carried out for economic reasons and through a process which lacks clear and precise standards for assessing the public interest or necessity and which also lack transparent review processes. Instead, most zone expropriations are approved through the arbitrary judgement of developer agencies or professional committees and lack foundation in social consensus. At present, authorities in charge carrying out zone expropriations are only required to separately hold one public hearing before the development plan is approved and before submitting the zone expropriation plan. However, the absence of room for participation by the people in the process of drafting of plans that will seriously affect their own rights and interests means that they are only able to submit petitions after the drafts, and petitions submitted at this stage are unlikely to have any substantive impact on the plans since they are not legally binding.<sup>26</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>With regard to homelessness, the government has to date still invites local government and NGOs which apply to the government to ask for their opinions, while persons whose rights are directly affected still do not have opportunities to participate in the decision-making process.</p></li>
</ol>

### Participation by People with Disabilities

<ol start="71">
  <li><p>The design of mechanisms for participation in policy-making and expression of views by persons with mental or physical disabilities is not entirely in keeping with the principle of ‘nothing about us without us” or with the requirements of Article 33 Paragraph (3) of the CPRD.</p></li>

  <li><p>Legal revisions should be made to institutionalize public participation: At present, the discretionary power of executive agencies administrative agencies to decide whether consultations with the public or with stakeholders should be held and what kinds of formats should be utilized is often arbitrary and wilful. The MOJ should as soon as possible draft revisions regarding participation in public policy decision-making for review by the Executive Yuan and by the Legislative Yuan.</p></li>

  <li><p>The government should clarity the power and position of the Committee of Rights of Persons with Disabilities under the Executive Yuan. According to Article 33 of CRPD, States Parties shall establish a coordination mechanism and one or more independent monitoring mechanisms within government as well as ensuring the involvement and participation of the civil society. The current Committee, established under Article 6 of the CRPD Enforcement Act, has a broad yet vague mandate, making it difficult to define whether it is a national “focal point” as is described in Article 33(1) of CRPD, or an independent monitoring mechanism in Article 33(2). Furthermore, it is worrying to observe how the Committee, which only meets once every few month, lacks concrete work methods and procedures to execute its official tasks as various as the promotion and educational training of the Convention, the supervision of its implementation by all levels of government authorities and the research and investigation into the current status of the rights of persons with disabilities, etc.</p></li>

  <li><p>Subsequently, the government should also revise the existing Directions for the Establishment of the Committee of Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which fails to guarantee full participation of persons with disabilities and their representative organizations. Under Article 6 of the CRPD Enforcement Act and the Directions, the number of academic experts plus representatives from DPOs shall represent no less than 1/2 of the total number of committee members. However, in the Committee’s first member list, only one out of the seven representatives from DPOs is himself/herself a person with disability; several of the academic experts, who are undertaking government-commissioned projects on implementation of CRC and CRPD, are faced with moral conflicts or conflicts in interest. Thereby we propose that the Directions should increase the representative seats of persons with disabilities and DPOs up to 1/3 or even 1/2 on the Committee, and it is necessary to formulate codes of ethic and conflict of interest policies.</p></li>

### Citizen Participation in Policy-Making in the field of Rights of Indigenous Peoples

<ol start="75">
  <li><p>In recent years, there has not been noticeable improvement in the protection of the right of consent and the right of participation in decision-making for indigenous peoples. In the overwhelming majority of cases of public - and private - sector development, research, regulation and land-use planning, indigenous peoples have only been able to at most only able to hold “tribal councils” and resolve either to give consent or reject the plan. Only in rare cases have indigenous peoples been involved in the processes of advance planning discussion and formulation. In addition, even though the Executive Yuan Council for Indigenous Peoples (CIP) drafted and enact on January 4, 2016 “Regulations for Indigenous Peoples or Tribes Being Consulted, Obtaining Their Consent and Participation” based on Articles 21, 22 and 31 of the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law (IPBL), the substantive content of the new regulations is divorced from the social reality of indigenous peoples in Taiwan.<sup>27</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>For example, Article 2 of the “Regulations for Indigenous Peoples or Tribes Being Consulted, Obtaining Their Consent and Participation” require the members of an indigenous village to establish their household registration in the village instead of allowing the village itself to define the qualifications for membership in the community. This provision infringes on the rights of participation in village decision-making and development for indigenous people who are working or studying outside of the village. Article 5 of the regulations decrees that the “village council” is the highest institution of executive power in the village and Article 11 also mandates that “(t)the convention, resolutions and all procedures or methods decided upon by village officers that violate the stipulations of these regulations or the bylaws of the village are invalid.” These powerful articles compel indigenous peoples and all indigenous villages to set aside traditional pluralistic internal decision making or regulation models and require that they can only accept the council format recognized by the government. These stipulations gravely restrict the right of self-determination of indigenous peoples and clearly transgress the provisions of Article 4 and Article 18 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</p></li>

  <li><p>The self-governance functions of indigenous people traditionally formed through a pluralistic autonomous decision-making and regulation model within the scope of each indigenous people and tribe. On December 16, 2015, a revision to the IPBL was enacted after passage by the Legislative Yuan including a new Article 2-1 which stipulated that: “In order to promote the healthy autonomous development of indigenous peoples tribes, each tribe should establish a tribal council. Each tribe will be recognized as ‘tribal public corporations’ through the central indigenous peoples responsible agency.” This provision aimed to use the legal institutions of a modern state to grant a status of a subject to indigenous peoples law and use the form of “tribal public corporation” to return the capabilities of self-determination and self-governance to indigenous peoples. However, how the government will take any concrete action to realize this concept must still be monitored.<sup>28</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>In summation, we recommend:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>When government agencies at all levels implement or monitor development, research, regulation or land utilization planning in indigenous peoples regions, they should uphold the comprehensive rights of indigenous peoples to participate in the formation of the content of planning, evaluation and implementation and realization of self-governance.</p></li>

      <li><p>Besides realizing the provisions of Article 21 of the IPBL, government policy making should respect the principles of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to secure their “free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them” (Article 19) and to ensure their full and effective participation of indigenous people in related processes.</p></li>

      <li><p>When drafting and enacting regulations for the organization of tribal public corporations based on Article 2-1 of the IPBL, the CIP should ensure that the scope of the new rules has considerable flexibility and freedom and should avoid adopting a legalistic unitary and stereotyped image that would restrict the existing tribal autonomy. The current “Regulations for Indigenous Peoples or Tribes Being Consulted, Obtaining Their Consent and Participation” should also be revised based on similar standards.</p></li>

  <li>According to Article 56 of the Equalization of Land Rights Act, the government at various levels may select areas for land consolidation plans. This process is termed urban land consolidation implemented by the public sector. Article 58 of the same act mandates that the competent authorities may encourage landowners to organize groups by themselves for the purpose of implementing urban land consolidation in order to promote land use and acceleration consolidation. This process is termed urban land readjustment implemented by the private sector. Urban land readjustment and zone expropriation are similar in that, after the land acquired is readjusted and allocated for the determined use and land used for public installations is deducted, landowners are compensated with cash payments for the remaining plots of undeveloped land to not meet the minimum area requirements for construction. The main differences are that urban land adjustment is carried out with regard to urban land and that the joint burden ratio is relatively less with a ceiling of 45%.</li>
  <li>The thresholds for approval of urban land consolidation implemented by the private sector are agreement of at least half of the landowners. When the landowners who agree possess at least half of the land area to be included in the consolidation, the proposed case can be reported to the responsible government agency for approval.</li>
  <li>See Article 23 of the "Encouragement Regulations for Landowners in Implementing  Urban Land Readjustment" <a href="http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawContent.aspx?PCODE=D0060012" target="_blank">http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawContent.aspx?PCODE=D0060012</a>.</li>
  <li>In recent years, the summaries of expropriation plans still only discuss the population and land area and other statistical data and contain platitudes such as “there will be no impact of expropriation on population age structure,” “there are no concerns for the budgetary sources of expropriation expenditures,” “tax revenues from developed land will rise” or “the area of agricultural land involved in expropriations will not affect grain security” and ignore the impact of expropriations on procedural and substantive housing and work rights.</li>
