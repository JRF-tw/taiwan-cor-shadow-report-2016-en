## COR Points 42-43 Access by Persons with Disabilities to Appropriate Employment

<ol start="167">
  <li><p>It is difficult for physically and mentally disabled persons to secure employment. According to the 2014 Report on Labour Conditions for Physically and Mentally Disabled Citizens, the labour participation rate for physically and mentally disabled persons rose slightly from 19.1% in 2011 to 19.7% in 2014, but remains far below the average labour participation rate of 58.54%.</p></li>

  <li><p>The low labour participation rate for disabled persons is not entirely due to the incapabilities of physically or mentally disabled persons. In a labour market in which prices (i.e., wages) are determined by production performance, physically or mentally disabled persons do not meet the expectations for production efficiency in the labour market and are relegated secondary labour markets if not excluded from the labour market entirely. Although the government has provided employment promotion measures, these programs are insufficient to allow physically or mentally disabled persons find suitable employment.</p></li>

  <li><p>From the 2014 data it can be seen that 31.3% of the physically or mentally disabled persons who have work are engaged in low-skilled or physical labour, regardless of their age or degree of education and that most are either janitorial or manufacturing workers. The character of the occupations in which disabled persons are employed is closely linked to the character of the employment promotion measures adopted by the State. For example, the range of categories of vocational training offered to disabled persons is limited and mostly concentrated in food and beverages, baking, cleaning, computer literacy, visually impaired massage, automobile washing and other such stereotyped categories. Since competition in these occupations is already intense in most ordinary employment markets, it is often difficult for provide effective employment guidance to disabled persons after such vocational training and easy for disabled persons to be find themselves in the ranks of the unemployed.</p></li>

  <li><p>In addition, the State has established special quotas for the employment of disabled persons. Current regulations mandate that in public sector agencies which have 34 employees or more, at least 3% must be physically or mentally disabled persons and that, in private sector agencies which have 67 or more employees, at least 1% must be persons with physical or mental disabilities. As of July 2015, the legal minimum quota was 53,421 persons but the actual number of employed physically or mentally disabled persons was reported at 75,252. Nevertheless, Taiwanâ€™s physically or mentally disabled labour force amounted to 212,171 in 2014, of which severely disabled persons accounted for 97,843. Hence, the number of persons employed due to official quotas was unable to ensure employment to severely disabled persons and many public or private agencies were willing to pay fines instead of employ physically or mentally disabled persons.</p></li>
