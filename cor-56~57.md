## COR Points 56-57 The Right to Life (ICCPR Article 6)

<ol start="246">
  <li><p>In response to Point 56 of the Conclusions and Recommendations, the MOJ has yet to follow the recommendation to immediately cease execution of death penalties and make efforts toward abolition of the death penalty in compliance with related United Nations resolutions. “The current policy of the MOJ regarding abolition of the death penalty is to maintain the death penalty but reduce its use.” In 2013, six persons were executed; in 2014 five persons were executed; in 2015, six persons were executed, for a total of 17 persons since the beginning of 2013. It is evident that the number of executions has not declined. However, there appears to be a declining trend in the number of finalized death sentence issued by the judiciary: three death sentences were finalized in 2013, one in 2014 and none in 2015.</p></li>

  <li><p>Point 57 in the Conclusions and Recommendations urges that the Taiwan government “should ensure that all relevant procedural and substantive safeguards relating to the imposition and execution of capital punishment are scrupulously adhered to.” However, a review of the 17 executions since the beginning of 2013 shows the following: (1) Courts in Taiwan still adopt a relatively conservative stance regarding the question of the suitability of issuing death sentences to persons with mental or intellectual disabilities and have not arrived at a consistent standard. We propose that an article should be added to the Criminal Code that explicitly and clearly stipulates that persons with mental or intellectual disabilities cannot be given death sentences; (2) In 2013, 26 petitions for amnesty for confirmed death penalty sentences were submitted to the President, but were ignored by the President who neither approved or denied these petitions. Four of the 26 petitioners for amnesty subsequently were executed. Therefore, we recommend that the Amnesty Act be revised to add procedures for the confirmation of applications for amnesty or commutation of sentences and to establish a consultative committee in the Office of the President regarding amnesty or commutation of sentences; and, (3) Since December 2012, the Supreme Court has begun to allow oral arguments in death penalty cases. This action has ensured that all condemned convicts can have verbal defence from their lawyers in appeals to the trial of third instance, namely the Supreme Court. However, observation of the 14 cases of appeals to the Supreme Court with oral argument indicate that there are no definite procedures or guidelines and that there is a huge gap between promise and reality. A minority of cases have been returned to the Supreme Court without hearings; in cases where hearings have taken place. In cases for which hearings are being held, most have initiated preparatory procedures and oral arguments, but preliminary proceedings or oral arguments have not yet been held for a minority of such cases and there have been cases in which the Supreme Court delivered its verdicts even though there had only had preliminary proceedings but no oral arguments. The focus of argument in the Supreme Court usually concerns sentencing, but the defendants are not allowed to appear in court. Therefore, we urge the Supreme Court to formulate guidelines for oral argumentation with substantive content and permit defendants to appear in court hearings.</p></li>
