## COR Points 22-23 Corporate Responsibility
### The unsettled incident of pollution in Ha Tinh Province, Vietnam, by Formosa Ha Tinh Steel

<ol start="79">
  <li><p>Formosa Ha Tinh Steel (FHTS) is a joint venture of Formosa Plastics Group and China Steel, and Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is the major stockholder of the latter. Starting in April 2016 and lasted for several weeks, a large number of dead fish were found on the coast of Ha Tinh where FHTS was located. Several divers employed by FHTS and residents nearby also suffered from illnesses and one diver died shortly after diving. The incident caused panic and anger among communities and caught international attention. It has not been confirmed whether pollution from FHTS was responsible for these events. However, there have been several precedencies where Taiwanese corporations violated human rights and damaged the environment in other countries. Prominent examples in recent years include human trafficking in Cambodia, forced labor in distant water fishery, forced evictions in Koh Kong province (Cambodia) by a sugar plantation invested by Ve Wong Corporation, and the closing down of a Korean company Hydis by E-Ink Holdings following a merger.</p></li>

  <li><p>Business activities have great influence over the lives and rights of people, so ensuring that foreign investments abide by international human rights norms is part of a state’s duty to protect. Regarding the FHTS incident, the government cannot evade its duty of monitoring and management, given its direct involvement in China Steel. However, in Government’s Follow-up Reports to the Concluding Observations, there is no mentioning of regulating and monitoring foreign investment of Taiwanese corporations. In fact, nothing took place in the interim three years except one public hearing on corporate social responsibilities.</p></li>

  <li><p>The facts about the pollution around FHTS are still unclear. The statement by the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) has been inconsistent. It is unclear why the FPG paid 500 million US dollars to the Vietnam government. Was it a compensation based on humanitarian considerations, a reparation for actual damages, a bailout for the safety of high-level managers, or collusion between FPG and the Vietnamese government? We demand a revelation of truths by the government, China Steel, and FPG. We urge the international experts to put this incident in the list of issues so that the government can properly address it and recognize its responsibilities in regulating transnational investment.</p></li>

  <li><p>The “New South Policy” is a slogan of the Tsai government, but we warn against the conspiracy between the government and corporations. The New South Policy has to be built on its concerns on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.</p></li>

  <li><p>We have the following suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The government, particularly the MOEA, should follow the UN Global Compact and the Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights adopted by the Human Rights Council, and strengthen its regulations on business governance, stock exchange, and investment.</p></li>

      <li><p>The conducts of corporations overseas should be regulated by law, including establishing a mechanism to investigate complaints of human rights violation, and pressing criminal charges for violations. The rights to protest and seek remedy in Taiwan by noncitizen stakeholders should be protected. There should not be further cases like Hydis workers who came to Taiwan to fight for their rights and ended up being deported and prohibited from re-entering.</p></li>

      <li><p>Human rights impact assessment, including the procedures and substantive contents, should be promulgated to evaluate potential risks and damages of business activities. For example, article 6.3 of the “Regulation for foreign investment by corporations” stipulates that foreign investment shall not violate international treaties, but the actual mechanism of safeguarding and auditing is not clear. The Invest Commission of MOEA should take definite moves. Human rights impact assessment should be a mandatory step in the evaluation for all international trade and investment agreements.</p></li>

      <li><p>National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) can play an important role in “Business and Human Rights” issues. President Tsai should keep her promise and establish the NHRC without delay.</p></li>
