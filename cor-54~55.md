## COR Points 54-55 The Right to Health and the Right to Education (ICESCR Articles 12-13)

### Diverse Gender Identities (LGBTI) and Human Rights

<ol start="244">
  <li><p>Data provided by the government are unable to concretely show the current government’s educational efforts on LGBTI human rights. The LGBT health centres mentioned in the MOHW’s response are actually concerned with AIDS prevention and do not have direct links with LGBTI mental or physical health. From the perspective of ending stigmatization, the high degree of linkage between LGBTI identity and AIDS should be discontinued.</p></li>

  <li><p>We offer the following recommendations:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Government statistics should concretely express the differences in sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. For example, the MOHW should provide data on the ratio of gender equity education that is aimed at LGBTI groups; the Ministry of Education should provide data on suicide prevention guidance counselling categorized based on sexual preference, gender identity and gender manifestation; and, the MOE should provide related data regarding LGBTI human rights education at all levels of the educational system. Before the provision of such data, it is impossible to judge whether government actions are related to the promotion of LGBTI rights in education and mental and physical health rights;</p></li>

      <li><p>Besides concrete actions in the field of education, the government must adopt further measures in employment, social welfare, medicine and health and other fields and, based on Article 12 of the ICESCR and Article 17 of the Yogyakarta Principles, maintain the education and health rights of LGTBI persons through clear and standing policies and expenditures;</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should work to bolster awareness among medical and education workers in their professional education and first line provision of medical assistance. For example, serious discrimination which in grave cases can result in the loss of medical care rights, can take place toward LGBTI persons with regard to the titles (such as Mister or Miss) used toward transsexual persons, the degree of understanding of the pluralistic groups among LGBTI persons, the LGBTI-friendly character of medical or health facilities (such as the degree of privacy and provision of LGBTI friendly rest rooms) and the recording of medical records.</p></li>

      <li><p>In the short term, the MOE should collect and formulate LGBTI human rights instruction programs and establish internet resource webs for persons seeking education, medical and health or social welfare assistance; in the medium to long-term, more multimedia public programs and public databases should be established.</p></li>
