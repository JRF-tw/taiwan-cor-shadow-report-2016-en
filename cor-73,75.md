## COR Points 73 (Freedom of Expression) and 75 (Freedom of Assembly) (ICCPR Articles 19-21)

<ol start="297">
  <li><p>The response of the State report to Point 73 only collates the types of existing restrictions on freedom of expression and lists the legislative reasons for these limitations. In form, the State report offers Article 23 of the Constitution and Article 19 Paragraph Three of the ICCPR in support of its position that all of these existing restrictions are in keeping with the requirements of the ICCPR, but provides neither substantive discourse on each of these restrictions nor genuine response to the Conclusions and Recommendations of the Experts.</p></li>

  <li><p>In addition, as noted in the State Report’s response to Point 75, the new Legislative Yuan with a DPP majority began to revise the Assembly and Parade Act soon after taking their seats February 1. The draft bill, renamed the “Assembly and Parade Protection Act,” completed its first reading in the legislative Interior Affairs Committee in May. The draft revisions replace the current requirement for permits and revoke all stipulations for special fines and penalties and shifts responsibility for administration from the National Police Administration or local police departments to the Ministry of the Interior or city or county mayors. However, the draft bill retains prohibition on assemblies in “safe distances,” previously named “prohibited zones,” and, although the zones are smaller, the number of places determined to need “safe distance zones” was increased. Hence, the overall effect on the locations for assemblies and marches has not changed. In addition, the unclear preconditions for utilization of new provisions for forcible dispersion of assemblies or marches may actually legalize police actions to disperse assemblies or marches.</p></li>

  <li><p>Even though the Constitutional Court declared in its Interpretation No. 718 issued March 21, 2014 that the permit system for urgent or spontaneous assemblies was unconstitutional, related corrective draft bills have been shelved. The government has instead drafted its own administrative rules to manage urgent or spontaneous rallies. This directions mandate that police still have the power to judge whether a rally is urgent or spontaneous and determine the identity of the responsible persons on site.<sup>134</sup> There are cases in which the police have used the lack of a site permit as justification to reject an urgent registration of a rally.<sup>135</sup> It is evident that these directions do not really protect the right to hold urgent or spontaneous rallies.</p></li>

  <li><p>Besides the legal issues raised by the Experts in the Conclusion and Recommendations, we believe that the restrictions on the freedoms of expression and assembly imposed by the Social Order Maintenance Act (SOMA) must not be overlooked. The provisions of this law regarding rumor-mongering, making loud noises that disturb public tranquillity or harassment are rarely applied, but still are utilized to curb freedom of expression and assembly. For example, on July 8, 2015, a man was fined NT$30,000 under Article 63 of this act for “spreading rumors in a way that is sufficient to undermine public order and peace” because he disseminated on the internet statements unfavourable to a certain political party. We must in particular point out that these articles in the criminal code and the SOMA are actually applied by the government, depending on the situation, in a targeted and instrumental manner to arrest, fine or indict people when it wants to suppress the freedoms of speech and assembly. These articles constitute a system for the criminalization of speech and protest and cannot be evaluated in isolation.</p></li>

  <li><p>Besides the question of revision of the legal code, the problem of the accountability of the police when enforcing law also gravely threatens the freedoms of speech and assembly. For example, dispersal actions carried out by police on the evening of March 23-4, 2014 and on April 28 caused numerous injuries to peaceful demonstrators. In a protest held on July 23, 2015 at the Ministry of Education, three journalists were arrested on the spot and prevented from communicating with their news agencies even though they did not violate the instructions of police.<sup>136</sup> However, the police have yet to carry out any effort to ascertain responsibility, impose sanctions or adopt concrete remedial measures for these actions which infringed on the freedoms of speech and assembly. These examples show that while the government claims that it has done its best under existing laws to relax restrictions on freedom of assembly, the content of current related administrative rules is both unknown and unclear and have not been able to place effective restrictions on excesses in law enforcement actions.<sup>137</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>Moreover, the National Police Administration’s internal affairs department, the Control Yuan and the judicial system have all been unable to investigate the responsibility for personnel involved in these incidents. The culture of impunity for the abuse of police powers continues to be a major threat to the exercise of the freedoms of speech and assembly in Taiwan.</p></li>

  <li><p>In addition to ensuring that the recommendations of the Experts are concretely realized in re-examination of the criminal code, the election and recall law and the assembly and parade act, we recommend that the SOMA and other administrative laws as well as police administrative guidelines also be included in the scope of re-examination and revision. Moreover, such re-examination should also pay attention to the suppressive effect on disadvantaged groups of fines, administrative charges and injunctions as well as criminal punishment. At the same time, the government should formulate a concrete and feasible system of supervision and accountability mechanisms with regard to police behaviour. Policies to ensure the protection of human rights should just be empty talk but must definitely and clearly impose sanctions when law enforcement powers are misused.</p></li>
