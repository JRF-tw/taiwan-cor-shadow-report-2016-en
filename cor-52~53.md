## COR Points 52-53 The Right to Health and the Right to Education (ICESCR Articles 12-13)

### Emotional and Sex Education

<ol start="234">
  <li><p>The Health Promotion Administration (HPA) of the MOHW has conducted a surveys of health habits of senior and junior high school students, but the object of such surveys has changed from year to year. Even though the surveys have used anonymous questionnaires, the topics are often quite sensitive, such as whether the student has engaged in sexual activity or whether the student has used contraceptives, and it is impossible to know whether the surveys receive fully accurate or reliable answers.</p></li>

  <li><p>The government has used these surveys of the health habits of senior high-school and junior high school students as reference material for the formulation of policies toward juvenile sexual behaviour. However, since there may be grave inaccuracies in the data used, it is also impossible to accurately evaluate the effect of sex education efforts.</p></li>

  <li><p>School sex education is limited to basic knowledge and lacks treatment of emotional education and intimate relationships and also avoids review or exploration of related power or domination relationships. In addition, such courses also lack instructional materials with content on diverse sexual orientations.</p></li>

  <li><p>We recommend the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The government should as soon as possible evaluate the effectiveness of sex education for minors and should especially adopt policies to cope with the high rate of pregnancy among female senior high-school students in certain areas;</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should comprehensively review and revise content on sex education in the instructional material on “Health and Physical Education” in public junior high-schools and elementary schools. The process of revision should include correcting gender stereotypes and gender prejudices and re-examine the content of sex education instructional material from the development needs and experiences of students and from the perspective of cultural pluralism; and,</p></li>

      <li><p>The government should develop sex educational content on diverse sexual orientations and gender identities (LGBTI) and when such content appears in textbooks, should take note of the experiences and needs of LGBTI students and include discussion of such topics in classes.</p></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

### Female Reproductive Health

<ol start="238">
  <li><p>Health care services related to female reproductive health provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare are mainly oriented toward “fetal health” and not “women’s health.” For example, content of the HPA’s handbook for pregnant women focusses primarily on how to care for the fetus and does not provide information on the situations and risks that a woman may face during her pregnancy and during delivery. The HPA has also not established any joint decision-making mechanism for puerperal and doctors and thus may create situations in which pregnant women overly rely on medical care or encounter unnecessary health risks.</p></li>

  <li><p>Even more worrisome is that over half of Taiwan’s rural townships or villages lack gynecologists and that the average age of gynecologists in Taiwan is five years higher than for doctors generally. By 2022, 49% of gynecologists in Taiwan will be over 60 years of age. In December 2015, the Legislative Yuan enacted the “Compensation Law of Childbirth-related Injury” under which the government will allocate budgetary funds to share the risks of childbirth. However, as the government has passively responded to the chronic problem of excessively low payments, this system may actually cause harm to women’s health rights.</p></li>

  <li><p>Besides providing reproductive care and cervical cancer screening, the government has not realized the threat posed to women’s health from gender gaps in the medical profession, such as the considerable amount of research showing differences between the clinical performance and treatment for men and women suffering from heart disease.</p></li>

  <li><p>In addition, while the overall rate of child pregnancies in Taiwan has maintained a level of 0.4% during the past five years, 2014 data shows that the rate of child pregnancies in eastern Taiwan (Hualien and Taitung counties) exceeded 1%, followed by Nantou County and Miaoli Counties with 0.7%. These figures indicate significant urban- rural gaps.</p></li>

  <li><p>Taiwan still lacks any legally authorized reporting system for abortions and only can depend on estimates based on surveys of student health behaviour. A comparison of student health behaviour surveys conducted by the MOHW Health Promotion Administration of juveniles between 15 and 17 years of age carried out in 2011 and 2013 had the following findings: the rates of persons who had sexual experience were 11% and 10.2%, respectively; the ratio of those who used contraceptives in their most recent sexual experience increased from 75.6% to 85.2%; and, the percentage of persons who had been pregnant rose from 0.4% to 0.6%. Analysis of the surveys showed that the ratio of juveniles who use contraceptives during their first sexual experience is clearly rising. We urge hospitals and gynecological clinics to carry out pregnancy registration and to provide data necessary to help estimate the number of abortions.</p></li>

  <li><p>We recommend the following: The government should provide “women-oriented” reproductive health care policies and bolster the efforts to raise the gender awareness of medical personnel in disease diagnosis and treatment in order to avoid causing unnecessary risks for women. We also urge the government to follow the recommendation of the Experts and carry out an evaluation as soon as possible of the effect of educational policies with regard to child pregnancy, particularly in areas where the rate of child pregnancy is especially high.</p></li>
