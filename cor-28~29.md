## COR Points 28-29 Gender Equality and Education

### Gender Equality and Education

<ol start="93">
  <li><p>Since 2013, conservative forces have incessantly used all types of methods to oppose gender equality education (including LGBT education, sex education and alternative family education) and have obstructed the gender equality education curriculum guidelines for the Twelve Year Basic Education Program. In the face of this backlash, the Ministry of Education has not only failed to uphold its obligation under the Gender Equity Education to actively support the rights of alternative gender students. Instead, the MOE has packaged these gender discriminatory ideological positions as “diverse social opinions” and invited their proponents into all kinds of policy -making bodies, thus leading to considerable back-tracking in Taiwan’s gender equity education.</p></li>

  <li><p>In January 2014, the MOE appointed persons who openly made homophobic statements or opposed LGBT education to become members of the MOE’s Gender Equity Education Committee for 2014-2017.</p></li>

  <li><p>The MOE has the responsibility for research and development of instructional materials for gender equity education, but when educational materials with progressive values came under attack by conservative forces, the MOE compromised with the conservative forces in order to calm the dispute. For example, after the conservative religious organization “Taiwan Union for True Love’ began in early 2011 to slander the gender equity education instructors’ resources handbook edited by university professors under commission by the MOE.</p>

​  <p>The MOE then began to delete or revise sections in the handbook regarding gay education. After 2011, the MOE never again commissioned the research and development of educational materials on alternative gender equity or gay education.</p></li>

  <li><p>Some members of the MOE Gender Equity Education Committee appointed for the two year term of 2014-2015 spent a great deal of time in meetings discussing the case of an educational video entitled “Shall We Swim?” produced by the Taiwan Gender Equity Educational Association in 2011 for viewing by senior high-school students. In the wake of repeated demands, the MOE issued an official document instructing senior and junior high schools and elementary schools that this video “cannot be used” and proposed a motion demanding that the MOE restore the central review mechanism for vetting civic educational material. This action not only constrained he promotion and discussion of gender education issues and also is a concrete example of a violation of democracy and freedom of expression.</p></li>

  <li><p>We recommend the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Gender equity education committees at all levels should appoint experts and scholars, representatives of civic organizations and educational workers who have a sense of gender equity awareness as committee members;</p></li>

      <li><p>The Twelve Year Basic Education Curriculum Outline should explicitly delineate the content and implementation methods for gender equity education;</p></li>

      <li><p>Gender equity education should include the topics of sexual orientation, gender identity and anti-discrimination;</p></li>

      <li><p>the MOE should research and develop gay educational materials appropriate for all levels of schools;</p></li>

      <li><p>the MOE should review the existence of hetero-sexist and patriarchal ideologies in textbooks and ensure that school courses include the subjects of gender diversity and human rights;</p></li>

      <li><p>on-the-job training and educational courses for instructors should include opposing homophobia and challenging heterosexual privilege and thus help teachers bring these topics into discussions of cultural pluralism, anti-discrimination or social justice;</p></li>

      <li><p>Realize the content of Points 22-23 of the Concluding Observations and Recommendations from the review of the second State report on CEDAW.</p></li>

### Transgender issues

<ol start="98">
  <li><p>66. Transgender is still considered to be an illness in Taiwan. Transgender persons need to go through mental health diagnosis and surgery before they can obtain gender recognition. These requirements pose an extremely steep threshold to transgender persons who are already in economic disadvantaged conditions. The lack of correlation between self-defined gender and the legal determination of gender spurs the creation of a vicious spiral and persons who are unable to bear these dilemmas will finally end on the road to despair and disaster.</p></li>

  <li><p>We recommend that mandatory surgery should not be used as the basis for gender recognition but adopt the following framework based on the experience of Denmark: (1) All ROC citizens of at least 16 years of age can submit applications for gender recognition. Persons who are at least 16 years of age but who are not yet 18 will require agreement from their guardian; (2) mandatory surgery or mental health diagnosis will not be the basis for gender recognition; and (3) there will be a six month buffer period which will commence automatically after the application is submitted during which the applicant can retract his or her application.</p></li>
