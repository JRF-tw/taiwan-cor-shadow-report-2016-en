### Diversity of Families and Marriage

<ol start="312">
  <li><p>The MOJ denies the statement by the Experts that existing law is “discriminatory” in its denial of legal recognition of same-sex marriages or cohabiting partnerships. With regard to the existing legal ban on same-sex marriage, the Taipei City government on June 17, 2015 announced that it would allow same - sex partners to register “civil partnership certificates” at city Household Registration Offices, following a similar move by the Kaohsiung City government in May. However, after household registration offices had rejected the applications of many same-sex couples to register on the grounds that such registration violated Articles 972, 980 and 982 of the Civil Code, the Taipei City Department of Civil Affairs on July 23 resolved to ask the Constitutional Court for an interpretation as to whether such refusal violated Articles 7, 22 and 23 of the Constitution and whether the Constitution forbids the government from restricting marriage rights for same-sex couples. With regards to this issue, the MOJ advocates that the relevant provisions in the Civil Code do not conflict with the Constitution and stated that it had already provided its legal advice to the Executive Yuan.</p></li>

  <li><p>The MOJ has refused to submit related revisions to the Civil Code. Revising the Civil Code to permit same-sex marriages would not involve any technical problems. In the Legislative Yuan, two groups of lawmakers have submitted draft packages of revisions of the Civil Code for “equalization of marriage rights” (same-sex marriage) and both have had their first readings approved by legislative committee. Pressured by civil society organizations and lawmakers, the MOJ ultimately cited excuses to refuse to provide its own version of draft revisions such as claiming there was no social consensus and the proposed changes were too controversial and too far reaching in scope. Although the MOJ has put forward the concept of a “two-stage approach” to revision the Civil Code, it has yet to put forward even the first phase of concrete draft revisions to particular articles. With regard to the second stage objective of “legalization of same-sex partnerships,” the MOJ has not offered any clear direction or schedule.</p></li>

  <li><p>The MOJ has attempted to use public opinion as a condition for the implementation of human rights protections and, in an exercise of self-contradiction, refused to acknowledge the results of an opinion survey which itself conducted. On August 3, 2015, the MOJ opened online polls on the issue of the legalization of same-sex marriage. We believe that questions of the realization of fundamental human rights for minorities should not be decided by public opinion polls. Nevertheless, the result of this online poll showed that a majority of the participants supported same-sex marriage. However, despite this result, the MOJ continued to insist on adopting a “two-stage” revision strategy and has continued to use all kinds of reasons to refuse to revise the Civil Code.</p></li>

  <li><p>Regarding the question of whether same-sex partners can register as “relatives,” an official of the Ministry of the Interior stated in October 2015 that the MOI “will conduct another evaluation after this issue is reviewed by the MOJ.” It needs to be explained that, under Taiwan’s legal system, the rights and obligations and legal status of relatives is far lower than that of spouses. Under the relationship of “relatives,” same sex partners cannot act on behalf of their spouse or decide cannot ensure that same-sex partners to resolve problems of discrimination or difficulties faced by their partner in life or law.</p></li>
