## COR Points 44-45 Trade Union System (ICESCR Article 8)

### The right to organize labour unions (the right of solidarity) is still subject to unreasonable restrictions

<ol start="171">
  <li><p>Teachers are still banned from organizing enterprise labour unions (i.e., school unions) but are only allowed to organize city or county level “professional” or “industrial” unions.</p></li>

  <li><p>Most private school teachers do not are to join unions out of fear that they will be harassed by employers. Since Taiwan suffers from a gravely low birth rate and recruiting new students to private schools is difficult, school managements arbitrarily reduce salaries and research funding for teachers. Under such pressure, there is virtually no room for unions to represent staff or engage in collective bargaining with management.</p></li>

  <li><p>Public service employees are still prohibited from organizing labour unions. Firefighters have struggled for over two years to organize a union, but as yet have been unable to form a labour union but only organize a “National Association for Firefighters' Rights.” In 2014, Hsu Kuo-yao, a firefighter with the Kaohsiung City Fire Department who initiated the association, was given over 40 demerits in three months, resulting in his eventual dismissal from the force.<sup>68</sup></p></li>

### Officers in teachers’ unions lack legal guarantees to engage in union work and are subject to other unreasonable restrictions

<ol start="174">
  <li><p>Article 36 of the Labour Union Act only ensures official leave for officers (i.e., directors or supervisors) of “corporate unions” to carry out union affairs and officers of non-corporate unions must negotiate with employers on whether they can have official leave for conducting union affairs. During the four years that this stipulation has been in effect, there has not been any progress in negotiating official leave for officials of “national” and “city or county” professional or industrial teachers’ unions to obtain official leave for the conduct of union affairs. As a result, such unions have had to resort to continuing to use the period of “teacher association meetings” to conduct union affairs. However, this procedure has no legal guarantees and there have been cases in which city or county mayors or principals have threatened to revoke official leave for teacher association meetings. In addition, on August 14, 2014, the Control Yuan issued a “correction” to the Ministry of Education maintaining that “there is no basis in law for the conduct of affairs in teacher associations to be granted official leave.”<sup>69</sup> Subsequently, in September 2015, the mayor of Nantou County revoked official leave for the operations of teacher associations and has also delayed any negotiations with the teachers unions on the granting of official leave for the conduct of union affairs.<sup>70</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>The Labour Union Act mandates that directors and supervisors of unions can have official leave to carry out union affairs, but does not stipulate that such leave cannot be granted to union officers who are not directors or supervisors. The MOL has expressed agreement with this view. However, in a report on an investigation issued regarding “union affairs leave for teachers’ unions” issued August 14, 2014, the Control Yuan took it upon itself to interpret the Labour Union Act and determine that only union directors and supervisors were entitled to official leave for the conduct of union affairs.<sup>71</sup> Various city and county mayors or school principals have used this finding to refuse official leave to union officials for the conduct of union affairs in evident violation of the autonomy of union personnel management. The above-mentioned Control Yuan “correction” even maintained that the mere holding of consultations between Ministry of Education and the National Federation of Teachers’ Unions on “the principles of handling leave for union affairs” was illegal.</p></li>

  <li><p>In November 2014, the Nantou Teachers Union (NTU) because it disclosed that a junior high school in Nantou County was engaging in illegal discriminatory “ability grouping” of classes. Subsequently, after the Nantou County government did not issue a correction order, the NTU submitted a petition for the Control Yuan to conduct an investigation. However, members of the Nantou County Assembly criticized the NTU during an assembly session on the grounds of “how can you sue the mayor while taking salary from the county government?” and for “using official leave to conduct union affairs to disrupt education” and demanded that the county government revoke official leave for the NTU. The Nantou County mayor agreed to the demand on the spot.<sup>72</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>The NFTU makes the following recommendations: (1) If teachers cannot organize corporate unions, the Labour Union Act could be revised to provide guarantees for official leave for the conduct of union affairs to “professional unions” and “industrial unions” and for space for union meetings depending on the size of membership; and (2) the Control Yuan should be asked to revoke the above-mentioned investigation and correction which restrict granting of official leave for union business to directors or supervisors in violation of the ICCPR and ICESCR. Progress in “collective bargaining” has been slow and the MOE and the MOL have permitted the stigmatisation of the right of collective bargaining for teachers
</ol>

### Slow progress of collective bargaining

<ol start="178">
  <li><p>According to the MOL, the number of collective bargaining agreements increased from 75 in 2006 to 300 in 2014. However, nearly 200 of these cases were agreements signed by the Kaohsiung Teachers Union and various schools in Kaohsiung City which only had one stipulation, namely that schools should deduct union fees from salary of teachers on behalf of the union. Hence, these agreements should really be considered as only one case which has far greater symbolic than substantive significance for collective bargaining. If these 200 or so agreements with public schools are deducted, the number of “collective bargaining agreements” signed with unions by other public or state enterprises is reduced to a handful.</p></li>

  <li><p>In 2015, the Yilan County Teachers Union signed a “collective bargaining agreement” with the Yilan County government which explicitly stipulated an “eight-hour working day.” However, this stipulation was attacked in major news media, the Secondary and Elementary School Principals Association of the ROC, the National Alliance of Parent Organizations and Yilan County assemblypersons as “interfering with the right of children for education.” The then education minister Wu Ssu-hwa stated that “(i)f students are still around, teachers should be too” as if teachers had right to time off work. The MOL remained silent in the face of these distorted statements and did not offer any public explanation of the values of importance of collective bargaining for labour and the eight-hour working day. On November 26, 2015, Yilan County Mayor stated during question period in the Yilan County Assembly that he “cannot agree that teachers are workers.”<sup>73</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>The Labour Union Act was revised to allow teachers to organize unions four years ago, but only three private schools have signed collective bargaining agreements with teachers’ unions due to the assistance of the NFTU.</p></li>
</ol>

### The right to strike and arbitration

<ol start="181">
  <li><p>Teachers’ unions still do not have the right to strike and there has been no progress on resolving this issue during the past two years.</p></li>

  <li><p>In its response to the Concluding Observations and Recommendations to the first State review, the MOL stated that a new “arbitration” mechanism had been added to the “Act for Settlement of Labour-Management Disputes’,’ included in revisions to the act, which took effect in May 2011, to compensate for the fact that the right to strike has not yet been granted to teachers. However, the NFTU has discovered that since the implementation of this system to this date, regardless of whether arbitration or adjudication is adopted, most of the members of the arbitration or adjudication committees are appointed from government agencies and have pro-government positions that are unfavourable to the NFTU. After the Control Yuan’s Correction No.103 (Education) 0115 was issued in August 2014, the judgments in adjudications have been even more unfavourable to union. In order to avoid the application of this correction in future adjudications, the NFTU would prefer that adjudication be dropped.</p></li>

  <li><p>Teachers’ unions believe the right to strike should be placed in the hands of the unions and that it is unsuitable to depend on “external assistance” mechanisms such as arbitration or adjudication.</p></li>
