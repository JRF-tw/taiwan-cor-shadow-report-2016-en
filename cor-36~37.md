## COR Points 36-37 Right to Work (ICESCR Article 6)

<ol start="130">
  <li><p>The government has taken note that responsibility for family care is the main reason for the low female labour participation rate in Taiwan, but still has yet to promote measures to reduce the burden borne by women. For example, a system of “paid family care leave” should need to take care of their family. Civil service employees only have five days “paid family care leave” and the preconditions for taking such leave are very stringent, but ordinary workers do not even have one day of “paid family care leave.” Moreover, affordable, quality and universally accessible public childcare or long-term care services are severely deficient<sup>51</sup> and as high as 90 percent of infants of three years of age or less are still cared for by the family alone.<sup>52</sup> The Awakening Foundation estimates that 80 percent of incapacitated senior citizens over 65 years old who also depend on their families for care.<sup>53</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>The government mentioned the establishment of nationwide employment service centres, the provision of mobile services and other employment promotion measures, but it is not clear whether the State report’s data for the number of women who secured employment through these channels refers to actual number of women assisted or “person times” and it is therefore difficult to see the effect of these measures on the promotion of employment among women.</p></li>

  <li><p>In 2015, the government finally initiated its first “Survey of Unpaid Parental Leave for Raising Children and Care Employment.”<sup>54</sup> The parent population of the survey is limited to workers who “have already requested subsidies for childcare leave or unpaid childcare leave.” Consequently, there is a huge gap between the results of the survey and the personal life experiences of Taiwan female workers. Many female workers have told civil society organizations that employers will deliberately give pregnant workers a hard time and refuse to grant applications for infant-care leave or demand that workers who want infant-care leave should accept demotions, wage reductions or deductions in performance evaluations or even demand that the worker resign at her own initiative after the end of the infant-care leave period. In summary, such difficulties may not be reflected in the survey results due to the design of the government survey.</p></li>

  <li><p>Due to their insufficient and scattered nature, official statistical data, professional surveys and research cannot accurately reflect the trials faced by people (especially women who have difficulty obtaining regular employment due to their family care responsibilities. Civil society organizations proposed to the Department of Gender Equity in 2014 that the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics undertake a special survey on “work and life balance, “ but the government did not accept this suggestion.<sup>55</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>Despite the above-mentioned difficulties, the government has adopted “policy proposals on the flexibility of women’s employment to create measures with regard to working during certain hours and certain jobs” (Table 2 in the State Report) as its core policy to improve the female employment rate. This strategy may encourage women to rush into temporary or part-time employment and thus expand the gender wage gap and lead to greater gender inequality.</p></li>

  <li><p>To promote gender equity at the workplace and in homes, we urge the government to conduct a special survey on “work and life balance” every three years to provide necessary data for public discussion and effective review of policy planning.</p></li>

  <li><p>The government should implement the Act of Gender Equality in Employment and ensure that measures adopted by enterprises can reduce the burdens of parents. In addition, in order to improve the environment for public childcare, we suggest that the government adopt the following measures: (1) actively promote the extension of affordable “non-profit nursery schools,” carry out annual evaluations of the results of such efforts and carry out regulation to ensure that preschool teachers and caregivers have reasonable wages or salaries and that surplus earnings are only be used within such nursery schools; (2) use idle space in schools to link with childcare facilities and services. Such installations and services should be price controlled to avoid price-gouging and profiteering by private interests. Their supply of services should be coordinated with employment needs and night-time and holiday childcare be added; (3) make better use of existing public day-care space and even establish more community childcare centres and set up caregiver matchmaking platforms to allow families to apply for childcare services that can be supplied by interested preschool teachers or caregivers. After making a match, the services can be provided through public childcare centres.</p></li>

  <li>In 2013, the average monthly expenditure for a household child attendant was NT$16,565; for a privately owned day care center, NT$14,071; and, for a public nursery, NT$8,802 (however, there are only 77 public day care centers in Taiwan). For day care during daytime during the work week, the average monthly expenditure would be NT$15,443. At the same time, the average monthly wages for female workers between the ages of 15-64 was NT$32,491 in the same year; in other words, monthly payments for child care would take 47.53% of the average wage of a woman worker.
