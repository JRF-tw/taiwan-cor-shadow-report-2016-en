## COR Points 24-25 Transitional Justice

<ol start="84">
  <li><p>The Experts have stressed the pursuit of truth and justice should take place in tandem with the provision of reparations. Civil society organizations have also repeatedly urged the Taiwan government to repeal restrictions on the right of victims of martial law era political cases (White Terror) to appeal the verdicts of military courts contained in Article 9 of the National Security and to review the Compensation Act for Wrongful Trials on Charges of Sedition and Espionage during the Martial Law Period.<sup>29</sup> This act limited the responsibility of the State for the White Terror to monetary compensation and also required the people to submit evidence that they were victimized. However, the government has yet to take concrete action to respond to Points 24-25 of the Concluding Observations and Recommendations and focussed its response on statistics of monetary compensation payments and persists in obstructing the pursuit of justice by the victims.</p></li>

  <li><p>The government has yet to follow the recommendations of the Experts to establish a “truth and reconciliation commission” as a mechanism to carry out a systematic investigation of the legacy of nearly 40 years of martial law rule. As a result, the knowledge of the victims and their relatives and Taiwan society at large regarding the historical truth of the White Terror remains limited. In her May 20, 2016 inaugural address, President Tsai Ing-wen stated the new government’s intention to realize this commitment and civil society needs to continue to monitor the situation.</p></li>

  <li><p>The government’s management and regulation of official files related to the White Terror has not been entirely reasonable and has failed to find a balance between the public interest of the pursuit of historical truth and the protection of individual privacy. The government has not effectively collected the party archives of the former ruling Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT) to assist in understanding authoritarian rule and has also not invested resources to collate, research and publish such files. The government has thereby been derelict in measures to effectively disclose the complete truth of the decades of White Terror.</p></li>

### Historical justice for indigenous peoples and transitional justice

<ol start="87">
  <li><p>Most discussion of transitional justice in Taiwan society is limited to the February 28th Incident of 1947 and the White Terror, both of which were created by KMT authoritarian rule. Nevertheless, indigenous peoples suffered even more severe infringements on rights during the long history of colonialism. Some of these tragedies were the product of errors committed by the KMT authoritarian regime and others were the responsibility of even earlier exogenous regimes or immigrants.</p></li>

  <li><p>First, even if the KMT authoritarian regime caused the February 28th Incident, the White Terror and the problem of illicit KMT party assets, indigenous people also experienced particular injuries with the confiscation of traditional lands, the murder of political elites, the improper policy of “turning the mountain land into flat land” by forcing indigenous people to adopt Han Chinese names and thus lose their own names, language and culture. Second, from a longer-term perspective, the issue of historical justice for the indigenous peoples on Taiwan must be faced jointly by all of the Taiwan people. From the Dutch and Spanish, the clan of Cheng Cheng-kung, the Qing Dynasty’s “Opening Up the Mountains and Pacifying Aboriginal Peoples” policy through Japanese colonial rule, the indigenous peoples on Taiwan have suffered massive injury and suffering. What is the historical truth? How can reparations and reconciliation take place?</p></li>

  <li><p>The State and Taiwan society as a whole should not pretend that the injustice suffered by the indigenous peoples on Taiwan never happened and this issue should not be seen as “only the affair of indigenous peoples.” However, in the wake of the January 2016 national elections, the historical justice and transitional justice for the indigenous peoples were neglected while the new Legislative Yuan and the new government actively promoted a draft “Act for the Promotion of Transitional Justice.” The new governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) refused to include the infringements on rights suffered by indigenous peoples together in the above-mentioned act and only agreed to include the issue in the work of the planned truth and reconciliation commission to be set up under the Office of the Presidency and which will be of a consultative nature with limited investigatory and administrative powers. As of June 30, 2016, indigenous peoples organizations have strongly protested this plan.<sup>30</sup></p></li>

  <li><p>We recommend the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The “Transitional Justice Promotion Commission” which the new government plans to set up under the Executive Yuan and which will have executive powers should include among its objectives “handling the improper infringement on the rights of indigenous peoples,” investigation and disclosure of the historical truth of the infringement of rights suffered by indigenous peoples on Taiwan and undertake the restoration of rights, reparations or compensation. The organizational design of the Transitional Justice Promotion Commission should also include provisions for the participation of indigenous peoples.</p></li>

      <li><p>The above advocations should be included in the draft Act for the Promotion of Transitional Justice and related subsidiary statutes should be enacted after promulgation of the mother law. Only in this way can Taiwan society be enabled to face together the historical experience of the indigenous peoples in the course of discussing transitional justice and, afterwards, steadily strive for reconciliation between indigenous peoples and the State and between indigenous peoples and other ethnic groups.</p></li>

  <li>“The February 28 Incident Disposition and Compensation Act” was enacted on April 4, 1995 during the tenure of President Lee Teng-hui (January 1988-May 2000). Under Article 3 of this act, the February 28th Memorial Foundation, which is still in operation, was established with the responsibility for issuing reparations and certifications of restoration of reputation, conducting research and the collection of historical materials, disseminating the educational, cultural, historical or human-rights significance of the 228 Incident and other tasks. Shortly before Taiwan’s first transition of political power from the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT) to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in May 2000, the government enacted the Compensation Act for Wrongful Trials on Charges of Sedition and Espionage during the Martial Law Period on June 17, 1998 in order to handle the wrongful and false trials during the 38-year period of martial law (imposed by the KMT from May 20, 1949 through July 15, 1987). Under Article 3 of this act, the government established the Foundation for Wrongly Charged People during the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of the Communist Rebellion on March 9, 1999. The foundation’s tasks included reviewing applications for compensation from martial law era political victims or their relatives, granting compensation, restoring reputation and other related tasks. This foundation completed its work and ended its operation on March 8, 2014. During its 15 years of operation, the foundation completed the review of 10,065 applications, of which 7,965 (79%) were accepted, including 809 cases of death sentences (10.15%), and 2,036 applications were not granted compensation.  The foundation also issued 4,066 certificates of restoration of reputation in 16 tranches. The foundation issued a total of NT$19.623 billion in compensation payments. This sum was taken by succeeding Taiwan governments from tax paid by the people for give to victims and relatives of victims of the White Terror as minimum compensation or consolation payments.</li>
